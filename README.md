# Airfare Price Prediction

## Overview
This project analyzes airfare pricing using regression techniques to identify key factors influencing flight ticket prices. We explore airline choices, travel timings, and class of service to predict price fluctuations.

## Key Objectives
- Analyze relationships between flight characteristics and ticket prices.
- Apply regression analysis to predict ticket prices.
- Provide insights to optimize airline pricing strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle’s Flight Price Prediction dataset.

## Technologies Used
- **R** for data analysis and visualization.
- **Regression Analysis** for predictive modeling.
- **Box-Cox Transformation & WLS** for improving model accuracy.

## Project Files
- `Report - Regression Analysis.pdf`: Full analysis documentation.
- `code/`: R scripts for data processing, model training, and visualization.

## Results
Key findings indicate that ticket prices are significantly influenced by:
1. **Service Class:** Business class tickets are considerably more expensive.
2. **Stops:** Non-stop flights tend to be cheaper.
3. **Days Before Departure:** Ticket prices tend to decrease as departure approaches.

## How to Run the Code
1. Install R and required packages (`ggplot2`, `MASS`, `car`, `lmtest`).
2. Load the dataset and run the scripts in sequence.
3. Review regression analysis results in the output.

## Future Work
- Improve model accuracy by incorporating categorical variables.
- Implement machine learning models for better price predictions.
